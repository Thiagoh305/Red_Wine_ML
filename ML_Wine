Wine Quality ML
This is an R Markdown Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

OBSERVING THE DATA LOADED FROM THE DATASET
winequality_red %>% 
kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = F,
                font_size = 22)
glimpse(winequality_red)
summary(winequality_red)
Looking at the Pearson correlations
chart.Correlation(winequality_red, histogram = T, method = "pearson")
ESTIMATING A MULTIPLE MODEL WITH DATABASE VARIABLES
model_wine <- lm(formula = quality ~ .,
                    data = winequality_red)
summary(model_wine)
confint(model_wine, level = 0.95)
summ(model_wine, confint = T, digits = 3, ci.width = .95)
export_summs(model_wine, scale = F, digits = 5)
STEPWISE PROCEDURE
step_wine <- step(model_wine, k = 3.841459)
summary(step_wine)
export_summs(model_wine, step_wine,
             model.names = c("Modelo Linear","Modelo Step"),
             scale = F, digits = 6)
Saving the fitted values of the model step_wine in dataset winequality_red
winequality_red$yhat_step_wine <- step_wine$fitted.values
view(winequality_red)
